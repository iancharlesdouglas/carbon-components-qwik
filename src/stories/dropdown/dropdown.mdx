# Dropdown

Shows a list of options from which the user may select a single option.  A popup listbox appears when the user clicks or uses the keyboard to open it.

The currently selected item is shown in the combobox field when the listbox is closed.

## Variants
There are several variants of the dropdown component:
- `Dropdown` - this component
- `MultiSelect` - dropdown with ability to select multiple items using checkboxes

## `Dropdown` Features
- Single option selection 
- Listbox may be navigated using a pointing device or the keyboard -- including arrow, PageUp/PageDown and Home/End keys
- User can type ahead to select a listbox item (typing e.g. `ba` for Banana) per WAI specifications
- Listbox items may be disabled for user selection
- Listbox popup may be positioned at `bottom` or `top` of field (`direction` property)
- Placeholder can be rendered if no option is selected
- Warning and error states with appropriate icons, borders, and state messages
- Label and helper text 
- Label may be placed above field or to its left (`type`  property: `inline`)
- Different sizes of elements (`sm`, `md` and `lg`)
- Full [WAI Combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox/) accessibility compliance for select-only combobox.

## How To

### Define a `Dropdown` Component
A `Dropdown` component must be enclosed within the following components:
- `Form`
- `CarbonRoot`

For example:
```
<CarbonRoot>
  <Form>
    <Dropdown items={['Apple', 'Orange']}>
  </Form>
</CarbonRoot>
```

### Define Items
You can define listbox items as strings or objects.  

#### Defining Items as Objects
If you define items as objects, each object must have a `label` property that contains the item's name, or you should define a render function (see below).

To supply a label for example:
```
const fruits = [{ label: 'Apple '}, { label: 'Pear' }];
```

#### Defining a String Render Function
To define a render function to render the item's name:
```
type MyItem = Item & { name: string };

const renderFn = (item: MyItem) => item.name;

<Dropdown itemToString={renderFn}>
```

#### Defining a Custom Renderer Component
To define a custom component to render an item:
```
const SelectedItemRenderComp = component$((props: ItemProps) => (
  <span>{item.name}</span>
));

await render(
  <CarbonRoot>
    <Form>
      <Dropdown
        selectedItem={myItem}
        renderSelectedItem={SelectedItemRenderComp}
        items={[myItem]}
      />
    </Form>
  </CarbonRoot>
);
```

#### Disabling Items in the List
Each item can be defined with a `disabled` property.  E.g. to disable the second option:
```
const fruits = [{ label: 'Apple '}, { label: 'Pear', disabled: true }];
```
While it is not possible for the user to select a disabled item, it is possible to set the `selectedItem` programatically to a disabled item.
You may wish to do this if you want to show an item previously selected in error.

### Set or Clear the Current Selection

#### Set current selection
Set the `selectedItem` property to the required item.

#### Clear current selection
Set the `selectedItem` property to `undefined`.
